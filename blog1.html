        <h2>Story of Vijay Kumar Patidar</h2>
        <p>A Civil Engineering graduate from IET-DAVV (Institute of Engineering and
            Technology, Indore), Vijay Kumar Patidar is currently pursuing his Ph.D.
            in Geotechnical Engineering from MANIT, Bhopal (M.P.). He
            simultaneously runs a volunteering organization registered as ‘Dishanjali
            Education and Welfare Society’ in the cities of Bhopal, Indore and Vidisha.</p>
        <p>Just like how every great work begins with an idea, Vijay Kumar Patidar’s
            journey started with an idea too. It was one of those evenings when he
            was sitting at Chai Ki Gumti with his friends, when a few children in filthy
            condition came over. On being questioned about their aims and desires,
            two of the children replied that they wanted study and the other replied
            that she wanted clothes. It was evident from their condition that they
            didn’t possess sufficient resources to afford either education or clothes.
            </p>
        <p>This experience might seem ordinary to others, but somehow it didn’t leave Vijay’s mind for days. Realising the
            difficult circumstances that these children were forced to live in, Vijay decided to do something about it. At that
            time, there wasn’t much he could do, but he knew that he could teach. So with passion to move mountains within
            him, Vijay started teaching underprivileged children right behind his university. Soon people got to know about
            Vijay’s initiative. Amidst a number of people who were mere spectators, Mr. Rajiv Baghel who was pursuing
            M.Tech in the same university decided to support Vijay. He encouraged Vijay to make his own team and spread
            his work further. Around the same time Vijay got to know about another group named Rang-De-Zindagi (now an
            NGO) which was involved in the similar work of teaching children since 2012.</p>
        <p>Gathering ideas from Rang-De-Zindagi’s operational plans, Vijay made his own team along with some of his
              juniors at the university in the year 2013 and named the team as ‘Jai Hind’. Apart from teaching children, the Jai
              Hind group also held parent teaching meetings which weren’t a happening in government or otherwise small
              schools. As Vijay’s work started gaining appreciation and acceptance, his good intentions started turning into
              dreams. Being aware about the predicament of education in the Indian society especially in the slums, Vijay
              decided that he needed to motivate the country’s youth to turn his dreams into reality.</p>
        <p>After the completion of his Bachelor's degree, Vijay handed over Jai Hind to his juniors and moved to Bhopal. In
                  the year 2015, Vijay along with the support of his fellow teammates renamed ‘Jai Hind’ as ‘Dishanjali Education and
                  Welfare Society’ and got it registered as an NGO. Post this accomplishment, Vijay started working on his idea to
                  associate with other groups which were engaged in working towards the betterment of the society. At that point
                  of time, this step was rather risky as one couldn’t guarantee if the outcomes would be satisfactory. But as the aim
                  was to develop a self sustaining system for the new generation, he decided to take the idea forward.
                  Vijay on the behalf of Dishanjali formed a cross volunteering association along with various other community
                  organizations and NGOs around the country and named the association as ‘National Association of Young Active
                  Volunteer’ (NAYAV). With the support of NAYAV, Dishanjali organized an event ‘Hum Honge Kaamyaab’. The event
                  was aimed at understanding the children’s interests and helping them pursue their varied interests such as
                  dancing, cooking, writing etc. free of cost.</p>
        <p>As the number of successful events organized by Dishanjali kept on increasing, their work gathered appreciation
                and Dishanjali was selected in the list of Top 25 social entrepreneurship ventures all over India by ‘Teach for India’
                for a one year long TFIx Incubation Programme. The programme was aimed at teaching fundraising and the
                maintenance of records for the purpose of showing the work done by the organization to the government. This
                selection by TFI was one of the biggest achievements of Dishanjali in year 2018.</p>
